## 🔍 Overview

This project is a fork of the original (https://github.com/nbd-wtf/bitcoin_signet) with some customizations in order to run stratum v2 with bitcoin signet.

Bitcoin Signet provides a sandboxed environment for Bitcoin, allowing developers and testers to simulate the Bitcoin network without the risks associated with the main or test networks. This Docker image facilitates the deployment and configuration of a Signet node, offering a range of customizable options through environment variables.

## 🛠 Environment Variables

### ⛏ Mining Configuration:

- `BLOCKPRODUCTIONDELAY`: Sleep period between mining blocks. Defaults to a specified value. (**mining mode only**)
  - If `~/.bitcoin/BLOCKPRODUCTIONDELAY.txt` is present, this value will be used, allowing dynamic changes.
- `MINERENABLED`: Flag to enable the mining chain. (**mining mode only**)
- `NBITS`: Sets the minimum difficulty in mining. (**mining mode only**)
- `PRIVKEY`: Private key of the Signet signer. If `MINERENABLED=1` and not provided, it will be generated. (**mining mode only**)
- `MINETO`: Address to mine to. If not provided, a new address will be generated for each block. (**mining mode only**)
- `SIGNETCHALLENGE`: Sets the valid block producer for this Signet. Required for client-mode.
  - If `MINERENABLED=1` and not provided, it will be generated. If provided, `PRIVKEY` must also be populated.

### 🌐 RPC Configuration:

- `RPCUSER`: bitcoind RPC User.
- `RPCPASSWORD`: bitcoind RPC password.

### 🌍 Network Configuration:

- `ONIONPROXY`: Tor SOCK5 endpoint.
- `TORPASSWORD`: Tor control port password.
- `TORCONTROL`: Tor control port endpoint.
- `I2PSAM`: I2P control endpoint.
- `UACOMMENT`: UA Comment displayed on `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` printout.

### 📡 ZMQ Configuration:

- `ZMQPUBRAWBLOCK`: bitcoind setting.
- `ZMQPUBRAWTX`: bitcoind setting.
- `ZMQPUBHASHBLOCK`: bitcoind setting.

### 🔧 Additional Configuration:

- `RPCBIND`: bitcoind setting.
- `RPCALLOWIP`: bitcoind setting.
- `WHITELIST`: bitcoind setting.
- `ADDNODE`: Add seeding node location. Use comma-separation for multiple nodes. Needed for client-mode.
- `EXTERNAL_IP`: Add public IP/onion endpoint information. Use comma-separation for multiple IPs.

## 🚀 Building and Running the Docker Image

1. **Building the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t bitcoin-signet .
   ```

2. **Running the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name bitcoin-signet-instance bitcoin-signet
   ```

**Note**: Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your machine before executing the above commands. Adjust configurations as needed for your specific use case.

## 🔧 Docker Commands

To make the most out of the Bitcoin Signet Docker image, here are some essential Docker commands:

1. **View running containers**:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. **View all containers (including stopped ones)**:

   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

3. **Stop a running container**:

   ```bash
   docker stop bitcoin-signet-instance
   ```

4. **Start a stopped container**:

   ```bash
   docker start bitcoin-signet-instance
   ```

5. **Remove a container**:

   ```bash
   docker rm bitcoin-signet-instance
   ```

6. **View logs of a container**:

   ```bash
   docker logs bitcoin-signet-instance
   ```

7. **Execute a command inside a running container**:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it bitcoin-signet-instance /bin/bash
   ```

8. **Pull the latest version of the image**:

   ```bash
   docker pull bitcoin-signet
   ```

9. **Remove an image**:

   ```bash
   docker rmi bitcoin-signet
   ```

10. **View all Docker images**:
    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

Remember to replace `bitcoin-signet-instance` with the name of your container if you've named it differently.
